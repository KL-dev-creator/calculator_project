# calculator_project
This repository is for the calculator project from The Odin 
I am aware that I have made the calculator more complex than I should have by calulating based on buttons.
Calculator evaluating more than a sigle pair of digits at a time caused complexity.
I recommend a different approach using objects.
Worked on from 7 October 2024 - 25 December 2024.


Known bugs:

Backspace on operators causes errors

Improvements for the future:
Attempt writing code with the same consistancy
