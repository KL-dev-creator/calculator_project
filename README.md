This repository is for the calculator project from The Odin 
I am aware that I have made the calculator more complex than I should have by calulating based on buttons.
Calculator evaluating more than a sigle pair of digits at a time caused complexity.
I recommend a differnt approach.


Known bugs:

Backspace on operators causes errors
2 / 6 + 4 = 8


Future improvements:
Keyboard interactivity
backspace button
